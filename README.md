# Forecasting Model Outputs 📊

This repository contains the output forecast data generated using three time series models:

- *ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)*
- *SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)*
- *LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)*

Each model was applied to a dataset for time series forecasting, and the resulting values were saved in CSV format.

## 📁 Files in this Repository

| File Name               | Description                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| arima_forecast.csv   | Forecast values generated by ARIMA     |
| sarima_forecast.csv  | Forecast values generated by SARIMA    |
| lstm_forecast.csv    | Forecast values generated by LSTM      |

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project is to compare traditional statistical forecasting techniques (ARIMA and SARIMA) with a deep learning approach (LSTM) for time series prediction.

## 📈 Future Work

- Combine and visualize the model outputs on a web dashboard
- Evaluate accuracy using RMSE, MAPE, etc.
- Add interactive comparison charts using Plotly or D3.js
